This example shows how to write a loop which has a variable bound and apply
pragmas/directives on such a loop. 

Note the following directives that are applied on the variable bounded loop:

# Specified in run_hls.tcl
set_directive_unroll loop_var/LOOP_X
set_directive_loop_tripcount -max 32 loop_var/LOOP_X
