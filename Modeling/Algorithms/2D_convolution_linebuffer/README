Running the Design (edit run_hls.tcl to set $hls_exec and enable specific run steps)
=========================================================
vitis_hls -f run_hls.tcl

This design implementation is efficient thanks to:
- The optimal design is filter11x11_strm
- It uses "streams": implements well in hardware
- it shows an example of using a line buffer for efficient storage
- It uses assert statements to state the known limit of loop bounds

The test case also performs a comparison against the more intuitive coding style in filter11x11_orig
