/*
 * Example code for a fixed-point "window function" based on a template class.
 * This example demonstrates several Xilinx High Level Synthesis (HLS) C++
 * language support features, ehancements and coding style techniques including:
 * - C+ coding style for ROM inference - init functions must be global-scope
 * - use of <cmath> functions to init ROMs - no HW created by HLS
 * - use of the ap_fixed<> data type in both HLS and C++ functional modeling
 * - code reuse/parameterization via C++ templates
 * - top level wrapper function for HLS of class objets cand methods
 * - TCL directive syntax for a class member (see run_hls.tcl)
 * - namespaces to control visibility and prevent naming clashes
