Running the Design (edit x_hls.tcl to specific run steps)
=========================================================
vitis_hls -f run_hls.tcl

This design is discussed in the Vivado HLS UltraFAST Methodology in the section "Writing Hardware Efficient C Code".
The attributes of this design which ensure an implementation with high Quality of Results are:
- the optimal design is filter11x11_strm
- It makes uses of streams: this helps you write code which will implement well in hardware
- it performs a comparison against the more intuative coding style in filter11x11_orig
- it shows an example of using a line buffer to save on storage
- It uses assewrt statements to state the know limit of loop bounds
